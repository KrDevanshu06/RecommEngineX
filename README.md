## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements a **hybrid recommendation engine** that blends:

- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** for latent-factor collaborative filtering.
- **Item-based collaborative filtering (KNNWithMeans)** using cosine similarity.
- AI-powered explanation generation using Google Gemini (via Kaggle API).
- Robust evaluation metrics including RMSE, MAE, Precision@K, and Recall@K.
- Interactive demo for personalized recommendations with insightful explanations.

The goal is to deliver not just accurate recommendations but also human-friendly reasons behind each suggestion, enhancing transparency and user engagement.

## 🚀 Features

- **Hybrid recommendation blending:** Weighted scores from SVD and item-CF models.
- **Cold-start handling:** Falls back to popular movies when user data is sparse.
- **Genre filtering:** Filter recommendations by genre.
- **Evaluation metrics:** Calculates RMSE, MAE, precision, and recall.
- **Visual metrics plot:** Dual-axis plot showing error and ranking metrics.
- **Gemini AI explanations:** Generates natural language insights explaining recommendations.
- **Interactive demo:** Showcases personalized recommendations and model performance.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KrDevanshu06/RecommEngineX.git
   cd RecommEngineX
   ```

2. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. (Optional) Set up Google Gemini API key on Kaggle Secrets for AI explanations.

## 🧑‍💻 Usage

Import and run the demo function for an interactive recommendation experience:

```python
from recommender_demo import enhanced_demo

# Replace with a valid user_id from your dataset
enhanced_demo(user_id=123, n_recommendations=5)
```

This will:

* Load and preprocess MovieLens data.
* Train the hybrid model.
* Generate evaluation metrics.
* Provide personalized movie recommendations with AI-powered insights.
* Visualize model performance.

---

## 📊 Evaluation

The evaluation module computes:

* **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
* **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
* **Precision\@K** and **Recall\@K** for top-N recommendations

Results are shown numerically and plotted for intuitive analysis.

## 💡 Gemini AI Explanations

Explanations generated by the Gemini AI model provide:

* Why a user might enjoy a recommended movie based on their viewing history.
* Focus on movie themes, styles, and connections to previously liked titles.
* Helps increase trust and engagement with the system.

## 🔮 Future Scope

* 🎯 Add rating thresholds to filter popular movies by genre.
* ⚖️ Implement weighted hybrid scoring to balance CF and content-based methods.
* 🖼️ Integrate movie posters via TMDB API for a richer UI.
* ✍️ Enable users to submit and update their own ratings.
* 🌈 Include diversity metrics to improve recommendation variety.
* 🔄 Develop fallback strategies combining popularity and similarity.
* 📊 Enhance genre filtering with popularity thresholds.
* 🔍 Improve similarity calculations with content awareness.
* 🛠️ Add robust error handling and monitoring.
* ⚡ Optimize data loading and model training performance.
